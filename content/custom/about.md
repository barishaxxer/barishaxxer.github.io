I'm Barış Can Kaya, a dedicated red teamer and cybersecurity enthusiast with a profound passion for offensive security, network defense, and ethical hacking. My journey in cybersecurity began with my curiosity about alternative operating systems, having initially been a Microsoft products user. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a deep fascination with Linux and the broader IT world.

## Desire to knowledge
---
Driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I am deeply committed to understanding technology from the ground up. Whether it's machine language, assembly, or the intricacies of computer architecture, I am determined to build a comprehensive foundation in these areas, even as I continue to master new skills. This core passion for learning fuels my desire to not only stay ahead in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape but also to grasp the underlying principles that drive modern computing.

## Why we should care
---
These simulated attacks empower organizations to address security flaws before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Additionally, red team efforts help to expose areas of confirmation bias, where overconfidence in a security system's effectiveness can lead to dangerous misconceptions about its true defensive capabilities.
