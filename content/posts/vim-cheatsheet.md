# Important to consider

Vim follows **POSIX BasÄ±c Regular Expression (BRE)** which slightly differs from **Extended Regular Expression (ERE)**.
BRE tends to treat characters as literals so involves more backslashes to give them special meaning.

ERE | BRE <br>
<code>&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; |&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;<br>
{5} | &bsol;{5}&nbsp; <br>
()&emsp;&nbsp;| \\(\\)&nbsp;<br>
\b &ensp;| &bsol;<&bsol;>
</code><br>
